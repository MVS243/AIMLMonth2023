Summary(Optional) :   The project performs Exploratory Data Analysis on the given Cirrhosis data set. Many relations are derived among the clinical features and stage of cirrhosis, confirming its presence or absence. Visualizations are added wherever possible. In the second task, Logistic Regression model is used to predict Cirrhosis. Each time the code is run, the accuracy remains around 50%. This indicates that more processing of the data may be required or more data needs to be collected to improve this score.
